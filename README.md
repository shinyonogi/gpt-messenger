# ðŸ¤– ChatBot For SRL (Self Regulated Learning)

We are currently in the process of developing an innovative chatbot system, underpinned by research, with the intent to revolutionize individualized learning experiences. By utilizing personal attributesâ€”such as age, gender, personality traits, and mental well-beingâ€”our chatbot aims to provide tailored learning pathways for each user.

Utilizing the Telegram and LINE Messaging APIs, the envisioned chatbot will act as a personalized learning assistant. As users interact with the bot, their messages will be promptly routed through our Node.js-powered backend system, ensuring swift and adaptive responses. All user data and interaction histories will be securely archived on Google Firebase, ensuring seamless learning continuity.

The ambitious vision for this system extends beyond immediate interaction. With continuous user engagement, the chatbot is designed to identify and adapt to the most effective learning strategies and schedules for each individual. From orchestrating learning plans, furnishing instant answers, to dispatching reminders, the chatbot aims to be not just a digital tool, but an engaged learning ally.
